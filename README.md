# Twitter Data Coletor

## Goals:

- Collect tweets from the program Fant√°tico, Show da Vida, presented by Drausio Varella. Available in [showdavida](https://twitter.com/showdavida/status/1234563236848119810?t=wurW-25yjDl_I5Ee1ajIkQ&s=09)

- Analyze the different feelings and meanings around the hashtag that occurred in the episode.

- Strategy: collect all comments related to the publication of the article in its entirety on the social network Twitter. Total tweets analyzed: x in the period from x to x.

## Observations

- Credits: Source code adapted from the example provided by Andrew Edward, available at [An Extensive Guide to collecting tweets from Twitter API v2 for academic research using Python 3](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-extensive-guide-to-collecting-tweets-from-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research-using-python-3-518fcb71df2a) for the use case of this master's degree research work.

- Important: to reproduce this code, it is necessary to register as a software developer on the Twitter platform, signing a data confidentiality agreement upon presentation of the reasons for data collection and acceptance by the company Twitter. Approving this registration allows you to receive security credentials to access data using a Twitter API.
